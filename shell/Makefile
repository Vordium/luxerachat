# Makefile for shell/ directory
#
# Description:
#   Provides convenient Make targets to invoke the various shell scripts
#   in this directory for building images, deploying, setting up services,
#   and running both backend & frontend locally.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   â€¢ Ensure this Makefile lives in the "shell/" directory alongside:
#       - build_images.sh
#       - push_images.sh
#       - deploy.sh
#       - setup_backend.sh
#       - setup_frontend.sh
#       - run_local.sh
#   â€¢ Make sure all scripts are executable: chmod +x *.sh
#
# Usage:
#   cd shell
#   make <target>
#
# Common targets:
#   help               Show this help message
#   build-images       Build Docker images (backend, crawler, newsletters)
#   push-images        Push Docker images to registry
#   deploy             Build & launch services via deploy.sh
#
#   setup-backend      Install, build & start backend in dev mode
#   setup-frontend     Install, build & start frontend in dev mode
#   run-local          Run both backend & frontend concurrently
