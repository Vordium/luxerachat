# Data Directory - EstateWise App

This directory contains the data analysis files and scripts used by our team
to understand the data available to us before building the app.

You can safely ignore/delete this directory in your local copy of the repository
as it is not needed for the app to run. However, if you are interested in
understanding the data and how we processed it, feel free to explore the files
and scripts in this directory.

We use/run these files locally to analyze the data and perform some initial ML tasks
so that we can get a clearer picture of the data and how we can use it in the app.

## JS Files

The JS files in this directory are used to analyze the data and perform some
initial ML tasks. They are not used in the app itself, but they may be useful for
understanding the data.

## Python Files

The Python files in this directory are used to analyze the data and vectorize
the text data. They are not used in the app itself, but they may be useful for
understanding the data.

## Bottom Line (TL;DR)

This directory is not needed for the app to run, but it may be useful for
understanding the data and how we processed it. If you are interested in
understanding the data, feel free to explore the files and scripts in this
directory. If you are not interested in the data, you can safely ignore/delete
this directory in your local copy of the repository.
