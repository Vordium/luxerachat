### AI Techniques

**EstateWise** combines a modern API, real‑time chat, and a responsive UI with a powerful AI stack to deliver hyper‑personalized property recommendations:

- **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses Pinecone for kNN‑based vector retrieval, then fuses retrieved data into generated responses.
- **k‑Means Clustering:** Automatically groups similar listings and finds closest matches to refine recommendations.
  - All features are also normalized to a range of 0-1 for better clustering and kNN performance.
- **Decision AI Agent:** Decides whether to fetch RAG data (via `queryProperties`); if yes, it pulls in the Pinecone results, otherwise it skips straight to the Mixture‑of‑Experts pipeline.
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** Dynamically routes each query through a master model to select specialized sub‑models (Data Analyst, Lifestyle Concierge, Financial Advisor, Neighborhood Expert, Cluster Analyst) for maximal relevance.
- **Feedback Loop & Reinforcement Learning:** Users rate responses; thumbs‑up/down adjust expert weights per conversation, and the system continuously learns to improve accuracy.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Each expert has a unique prompt template, ensuring tailored responses based on user input.
  - All experts, agents, and merger have a detailed and ultra-specific prompt template to ensure the best possible responses.
- **kNN & Cosine Similarity:** Uses Pinecone for fast, real‑time property retrieval based on user queries.

## Features

EstateWise is packed with both UI and AI features to enhance your home-finding experience:

- **Intelligent Property Recommendations**  
  Get tailored property suggestions powered by AI and Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG).

- **Secure User Authentication**  
  Sign up, log in, and log out with JWT‑based security.

- **Conversation History**

  - **Authenticated users** can view, rename, and delete past chats.
  - **Guest users** still have their conversation history saved locally in the browser.

- **Full‑Text Search**  
  Quickly search your conversation history for keywords, topics, or specific properties.

- **Rating System & Feedback Loop**  
  Rate each AI response (thumbs up/down) to adjust expert weights and continuously improve recommendations.

- **Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE) & Manual Expert View**

  - The AI dynamically routes queries through specialized experts (Data Analyst, Lifestyle Concierge, Financial Advisor, Neighborhood Expert, Cluster Analyst).
  - Optionally switch to any single expert’s view to see their raw recommendation.

- **Interactive Visualizations**

  - In‑chat, the AI generates live Chart.js graphs from Pinecone data so you can instantly see trends and distributions.
  - A dedicated Visualizations page offers aggregate charts and insights for all Chapel Hill properties.

- **Clustering & Similarity Search**

  - k‑Means clustering groups similar properties for more focused suggestions.
  - kNN & Cosine Similarity (via Pinecone) finds the closest matches to your query in real time.

## Setup & Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot.git
   cd EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables (adjust as needed):

   ```env
   PORT=<your_port>
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=<your_google_ai_api_key>
   PINECONE_API_KEY=<your_pinecone_api_key>
   PINECONE_INDEX=estatewise-index
   ```

   Important: Be sure that you created the Pinecone index with the name `estatewise-index` in your Pinecone account before proceeding. Then,
   add data to the index using the `pinecone` CLI or API. For security purposes, our properties data is not publicly available in the repository. Please use your own data.

4. **Upsert Properties Data to Pinecone:**  
   Use the `upsertProperties.ts` script to upsert your properties data into the Pinecone index. This script assumes that you place the 4 JSON files in the same directory as the script itself,
   under the names `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part0.json`, `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part1.json`, `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part2.json`, and `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part3.json`.

   ```bash
   ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/scripts/upsertProperties.ts
   ```

   Alternatively, and preferably, you can use the following NPM command from the `backend` directory to quickly upsert the properties data:

   ```bash
   npm run upsert
   ```

   Note that it may take quite long to upsert all the 30,772 properties data into the Pinecone index, so please be patient.

5. **Run the Backend in Development Mode:** After the properties data has been upserted into the Pinecone index, you can run the backend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the backend server with live reloading.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the client folder:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Change API URL:**  
   If your backend is running on a different port or domain, update the API URL in the frontend code (simply CTRL + F or CMD + F and search for `https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app` in all frontend files, then replace it with your backend URL - by default it is `http://localhost:3001`).

5. **View and Interact with the App:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. You can interact with the chatbot, sign up, log in, and explore the features.

> Note: As you develop, before committing, we recommend running the linter and formatter to ensure code quality with `npm run format`. This will format your code according to the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations.

## Deployment

- **Backend:** Deploy your backend on your chosen platform (Heroku, Vercel, AWS, etc.) and ensure environment variables are properly set.
  - Currently, the backend is deployed on Vercel at [https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app/](https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app/).
- **Frontend:** Deploy the React/Next.js frontend using services like Vercel or Netlify. Update any API endpoints if necessary.
  - Currently, the frontend is deployed on Vercel at [https://estatewise.vercel.app/](https://estatewise.vercel.app/).

  Easily search through your conversation history and manage your saved conversations from the sidebar.
- **Guest Mode:**  
  Use the app as a guest without creating an account. Conversations will still be saved locally in the browser.
- **Rating System:**  
  Rate the AI's responses to help improve its performance over time. If you are not satisfied with the AI's response, you can give a thumbs down rating, and the backend API will tweak the experts selection process (i.e. the weights of the experts) to improve the model's performance.
- **Expert Selection:**  
  The AI uses a mixture of experts to provide the best possible response based on user input. Users can also select a specific expert's response to view.

> Note: The expert view feature is ONLY available for new messages. If you load a conversation from either the local storage or the database, the expert view feature will not be available, and only the combined response will be shown.
